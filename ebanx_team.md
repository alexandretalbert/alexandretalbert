> aplicação. Esse projeto começou há bastante tempo, com a implementação de um processo de autenticação de serviço no EBMNG. Desde lá, até agora em que iniciamos de fato o deploy da aplicação, as

> raramente vemos na maioria dos desenvolvedores. De forma geral, quando sabemos que o Marlon está envolvido em um projeto, já é um forte indício de que a entrega será um sucesso.
